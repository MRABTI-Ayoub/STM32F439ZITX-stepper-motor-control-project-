STM32F439ZITX Stepper Motor Control Project

This project demonstrates precise control of a stepper motor using the STM32F439ZITX microcontroller. It utilizes timers and PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) to achieve accurate and smooth movements.
Features:

    Precision stepper motor control using STM32F439ZITX microcontroller
    Efficient timer and PWM implementation for precise motor movements
    Well-structured code for easy understanding and modification

Requirements:

    STM32F439ZITX microcontroller development board
    Stepper motor
    Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for STM32 microcontrollers

Usage:

    Clone this repository to your local machine.
    Install the necessary development tools and libraries for your IDE.
    Open the project in your IDE and configure the project settings.
    Connect your stepper motor to the STM32F439ZITX development board.
